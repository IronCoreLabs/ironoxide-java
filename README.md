# IronOxide Swig Bindings

This library is a thin Rust shim that wraps the [IronOxide Rust SDK](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/ironoxide) and uses the [Rust Swig](https://github.com/Dushistov/rust_swig) toolset to generate bindings. It currently contains SDKs for [C++](cpp/README.md), [Java](java/README.md), and [Android](android/README.md).
